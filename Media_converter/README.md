# Basic Media Converter Read Manual

### About the Project

This folder contains two scrips that perform basic conversion of either audio or video media files into different formats

Audio files can be converted into MP3, WAV, AAC, WMA, AIFF and OPUS formats

Video Files can be converted into MPEG-4, AVI, FLV, MOV, WMV and MKV video formats 

### Techniques Implemented

I made this scripts to implement different phases of me learning bash scripting

I tried to play around with several concepts to fully discover and enjoy the potentials of the bash shell 

All conversions are done using ffmpeg which is an open source utility and using the default codecs and specilaisations

For now you will only be able to use the default codecs for conversion. You will not be able make changes to things like bitrate, or compression level 

### Continuity
I will continue to add more scripts to this project as I go on

Any script added will have its functionalities listed in the Scripts and Functionalities section below

To continue to contribute to open source the scripts can be modified or tweaked and then pull requests can be made 

The scripts can aslo be modifeid to users specific taste so they can be used in ways best suiting to the user

If you feel there is need to add scripts for a specific purpose kindly reach out to me and I will ensure the script gets added 

### Scripts and Functionalities
basic_vid_con.sh = Ensure the script is being run from the same difrectory with the video files to be converted. <br>
Enter the name of the video file to be converted and select the format you would like to convert to <br>
Be patient as conversion will take a few seconds depending on the size of the file to be converted <br>
Successful message will be displayed once conversion is finished <br>

basic_audio_conv.sh = Same usage as basic_vid_con.sh <br>
 

### Usage
Kindly download the script and from your download directory (or copy into any directory of choice) and run ./backup_AIO.sh
