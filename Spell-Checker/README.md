# Spell-Checker Script

### About the Project

This folder contains a script that will scan a certain directory given by a user for text files with typo erros

The script will provide the user the oppurtunity to make corrections to the typo errors noticed.

The scripts also displays an interactive message to let you know when the spell-check is complete 


### Techniques Implemented

I made this scripts to implement different phases of me learning bash scripting

I tried to play around with the ( **aspell** ) command and also used the ( **readarray** ) command with ( **command substitution** ) to help store the files in an array so they can be easily accessed by the aspell command. < br > The ( **for** ) command was used to make the aspell command execute over a loop of the elements held in the array 

All scripts here are ideas I tried to implement in my own understanding and flexibility to acheive a desired functionality. Thanks for your understanding

### Continuity
I will continue to add more scripts to this project as I go on

Any script added will have its functionalities listed in the Scripts and Functionalities section below

To continue to contribute to open source the scripts can be modified or tweaked and then pull requests can be made 

The scripts can aslo be modifeid to users specific taste so they can be used in ways best suited to the user
