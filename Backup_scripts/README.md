### About the Project

This folder contains different scrips that will backup some specific directories of the Users PC

Some scripts are tagged ALL-in-one because it creates a backup to a single compressed gzip archive

The scripts also displays an interactive message to let you know when backup is completed 


### Techniques Implemented

I made this scripts to implement different phases of me learning bash scripting

I tried to play around with several concepts to fully discover and enjoy the potentials of the bash shell 

All scripts here are ideas I tried to implement in my own understanding and flexibility to acheive a desired functionality. Thanks for your understanding
